# ml-from-scratch

A curated collection of machine learning and neural network algorithms implemented from first principles using only Python and NumPy.

This project is designed to demonstrate complete mathematical transparency and engineering rigor behind core ML models—without relying on high-level libraries or frameworks.

## ✅ Key Goals
- Build foundational ML and DL algorithms from the ground up
- Reinforce understanding of matrix calculus, optimization, and activation dynamics
- Provide a clear path for testing conceptual understanding through code

## 📁 Structure
- `NeuralNetwork/` – XOR with backpropagation and SGD from scratch (more models to follow)
- Future additions: RNNs, logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, SVMs, etc.

## 📌 Why This Repo Matters
- Shows deep understanding of core ML mechanics
- Highlights implementation skill without abstraction layers
- Ideal for educational demonstration, technical interviews, and portfolio visibility

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
